## Organizational Radical/Extreme Adaptability During SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic

**Executive Summary**:

We live in an interconnected world in which nothing exists in isolation or in a vacuum. Shock and recovery from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic can be observed in firms’ earnings calls and share performance. Insights regarding adaptability (e.g. asynchronous collaboration, acting on foresight with agility, remote/hybrid work) and team-level practice of resilience (e.g. committing to each other and checking on each other’s wellbeing) can hopefully be gained from analyzing changes in the net COVID-related sentiment in their earnings calls—whose presentation can be subdivided into public relations management and actual improvements in operations and/or earnings. The latter of which can be gleaned from their 10k documents. Firm’s improvement/turnaround (in comparison to one’s peers in the same industry) in this context often involves either pre-existing positioning/alignment or repositioning/realignment around products, services, and/or operations. 

**Motivation**:

To learn best practices from firms that navigated the pandemic well, operationally, financially, and diplomatically. On the other hand, I can also see how someone can incorporate insights from this project into one’s investment strategy. 

**Data Questions**:
1)	Find firms whose Net COVID Sentiment had the largest delta over the period from late-2019/early-2020 to Mar-24-2022 (the most recent available data in this dataset)
2)	Segment/group firms according to the length of time it took them to traverse this delta. (R-Shiny Dashboard will come in handy here)
3)	Hopefully we will discover insights pertaining to: 
  a)	How do these firms journeys of recovery/overcoming compare to the average in one’s industry? (e.g. z-score)
  b)	Were there real changes / resilience related actions inside of those firms? Or was it merely a change in PR/diplomacy?
  c)	What do these firms' risk profiles look like in other regards? (e.g. economic, environment, trade, tax policy, ...)

## Mixed Effect Regression Analysis: How Changes in Stock Price Correlate with COVID Sentiment in Earnings Calls --> Organizational Radical/Extreme Adaptability During SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic + Finding Pricing Inefficiencies

**Executive Summary**:

We live in an interconnected world in which nothing exists in isolation or in a vacuum. Shock and recovery from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic can be observed in firms’ earnings calls and share performance. Insights regarding adaptability (e.g. asynchronous collaboration, acting on foresight with agility, remote/hybrid work) and team-level practice of resilience (e.g. committing to each other and checking on each other’s wellbeing) can hopefully be gained from analyzing changes in the net COVID-related sentiment in their earnings calls—whose presentation can be subdivided into public relations management and actual improvements in operations and/or earnings. The latter of which can be gleaned from their 10k documents. Firm’s improvement/turnaround (in comparison to one’s peers in the same industry) in this context often involves either pre-existing positioning/alignment or repositioning/realignment around products, services, and/or operations.

**Motivation / The "so what?" factor**:

The purpose of this project is twofold: 
(1) examine how markets react to earnings calls,
(2) identify potential stock pricing inefficiencies

Organizational performance of publicly traded companies are often measured by their stock prices (in relation to those of other firms in the same industry) – albeit a very imperfect surrogate marker. 

As a proof of concept, this project examines both phenomenological patterns and underlying mechanisms of action.

Aside from public relations / diplomacy, earnings calls are a source of insight into how a company is doing and the opportunities/challenges a company has encountered / will encounter. Along with quarterly earnings report (i.e. 10-Q), they tend to impact stock prices in the short-term. 

Usually, the market prices stocks efficiently, by considering all publicly available information. In the context of pricing a stock, efficiency means there isn’t any information asymmetry or gap(s) of understanding among the stakeholders (e.g. traders/investors, management team of the firm). Conversely, pricing inefficiency point to gaps / shocks / hidden surprises whose impacts/implications have yet to be fully realized by the price of a stock. 

Deviations in correlations (with COVID Sentiments, along with other factors) can hint at inefficiencies in pricing. Investors who want to beat the stock market often seek out inefficiently priced stocks. 

Hence, this analysis / app can be (use with caution) a screening tool for investors. Investors would then want to look up these firms’ 10k documents, in order to take a deeper look into financial health/unhealth of highlighted firms. 

Because this analysis is retrospective in nature, it of course has limitations in predicting the future. 

Parenthetically, this analysis/app serves as a screening process (as a 1st pass tool) potentially highlights firms that navigated through the pandemic exceptionally well. One can potentially glean best practices from highlighted firms, which include positive transformation include shifting to online sales/transactions, working from home, conservation of cash, quickly adjusting prices & offerings of products/services according to market conditions, and bringing furloughed employees back.



**Data Questions**:
1)	Find US firms' stock prices on the day before/after each earnings call. Then find the correlation between Net COVID Sentiment and stock price.
2)	Hopefully we will discover insights pertaining to: 
  a)	How do these firms journeys of recovery/overcoming compare to the average in one’s industry?
  b)	Were there real changes / resilience related actions inside of those firms? Or was it merely a change in PR/diplomacy?

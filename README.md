## Mixed Effect Regression Analysis: How Changes in Stock Price Correlate with COVID Sentiment in Earnings Calls --> Organizational Radical/Extreme Adaptability During SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic

**Executive Summary**:

We live in an interconnected world in which nothing exists in isolation or in a vacuum. Shock and recovery from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic can be observed in firms’ earnings calls and share performance. Insights regarding adaptability (e.g. asynchronous collaboration, acting on foresight with agility, remote/hybrid work) and team-level practice of resilience (e.g. committing to each other and checking on each other’s wellbeing) can hopefully be gained from analyzing changes in the net COVID-related sentiment in their earnings calls—whose presentation can be subdivided into public relations management and actual improvements in operations and/or earnings. The latter of which can be gleaned from their 10k documents. Firm’s improvement/turnaround (in comparison to one’s peers in the same industry) in this context often involves either pre-existing positioning/alignment or repositioning/realignment around products, services, and/or operations.

**Motivation**:

To identify firms that navigated the pandemic well, operationally, financially, and diplomatically. And to learn (hopefully best practices) from them. On the other hand, I can also see how someone might incorporate the insights distilled from this project into one’s investment strategy. On a cautionary note, COVID Sentiment in Earnings Calls is only 1 out of many factors that contribute to stock price and company performance. In many ways, this project is a proof-of-concept for analyzing a variety of factors that may correlate with stock price and company performance. 

**Data Questions**:
1)	Find US firms' stock prices on the day before/after each earnings call. Then find the correlation between Net COVID Sentiment and stock price.
2)	Hopefully we will discover insights pertaining to: 
  a)	How do these firms journeys of recovery/overcoming compare to the average in one’s industry?
  b)	Were there real changes / resilience related actions inside of those firms? Or was it merely a change in PR/diplomacy?
